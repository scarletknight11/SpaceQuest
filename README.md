SpaceQuest: Game was built off of roller madness game I made through a game dev course I took on Coursera
Major differences include deisgn mechanisms and gameplay scenes.
In addition, some of the modifications involve using libraries devoloped by Drexel university, replay labs spin-off startup, enAble games, 
an Active Video Game (AVG) platform that includes a suite of fun and challenging games for players with disabilities. Flexible gaming parameters enable each game to be tweaked and adjusted to best fit the therapy goals of each individual player.

Some of the technologies enable games uses involves VR/AR headsets, Microsoft Xbox Kinect V1 & V2, Orbeec Astra Pro & Leap Motion that patients with neurological conditions would use.
Some of those neurological conditions involve Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, Seizures, Strokes & more.

Step 6: Before signing into the platform make sure you download SDK for kinect motion tracking depending on which Kinect you are using.

V1 SDK: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40277

Step 7: Connect your Kinect USB device to your computer. Your Kinect should go on as you feel see an infrared light go on. 

Step 8: Sign in with your account you created on the website in the enAble games platform. Make sure your kinect is connected as you sign in
